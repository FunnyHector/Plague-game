# SWEN222Project
The Group Project, co-worked with Angelo, Rafaela, Dippen, & Daniel.  
  
So far this is the skeleton code for game world package. Most of components in the Model part are there, though I do believe there are huge amount of code to be done. I only added some methods as I brainstormed the idea, so some of them will be changed later.
