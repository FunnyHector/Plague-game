# SWEN222Project
The Group Project, co-worked with Angelo, Rafaela, Dippen, & Daniel.  
  
This version is almost integrated with every component, including game logic, client/server, renderer & GUI, and data storage.  
  
I personally wrote 100% of game logic and client/server, and 80% of the integration (it's not easy at all....).  
  
There are still bugs and lots of imperfections scattered all over the game, but it's due very soon. We'll do our best to perfect it.
