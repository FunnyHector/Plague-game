     * others. I mean they essentially have the same function: 1. displaying itself, 2.
     * blocking players from walking into itself. So a tree object can be constructed as
     * new Obstacle(x, y, "Weird looking tree", an-image-of-tree), then rock can be
     * constructed as new Obstacle(x, y, "Reaaaaally hard rock", an-image-of-rock).
     * 
     * If, in later stages, we have need to do separated classes for rocks or other stuff,
     * I'll make one then.
